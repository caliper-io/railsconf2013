# Railsconf 2013 mobile app

We wanted something to do on our train journey from Vancouver, Canada to
Portland for Railsconf 2013.

So we built something that will save us some data charges when looking
up the schedule on our mobile devices.


## Development

This has been written in <del>PDD (Pry driven development)</del> TDD (train driven development), so no tests here.

We have a master branch on this project that creates the cached JSON
data structure of the talks and speakers, you can access the latest
processed data here:

[http://caliper.github.io/railsconf2013/raw/data.json](http://caliper.github.io/railsconf2013/raw/data.json)

The javascript application sits on the branch pages.

## Bugs / Improvements

Feel free to fix or change something, send a pull request and we'll
merge it in.
